Specifically, ACFTA dummy variables are incorporated in the basic model is to estimate the direction and magnitude of the ACFTA effects. A total of 79 trading partners of ASEAN member countries plus China were examined in this article. The study finds that the Gross Domestic Product, population, natural endowment, distance and common language are the main determining factors of the bilateral trade for ASEAN member countries and its trading partners. Estimated results from this Augmented Gravity Model showed that ACFTA have increased the bilateral aggregate trades not only between intra-bloc member countries, but also between intra-bloc and extra-bloc countries. With this positive finding, ASEAN and China could consider to expand their free trade area to a broader regional perspective, to enhance economic growth and to reduce regional inequality.},

The authors address econometrically the endogeneity of FTAs using instrumental-variable (IV) techniques, control-function (CF) techniques, and panel-data techniques; IV and CF approaches do not adjust for endogeneity well, but a panel-data approach does.

Thirty years after the terminology of Non-Europe was used to give estimates of the gains from further integration, we use modern versions of the gravity model to estimate the trade creation implied by the EU, and apply those to counterfactual exercises where for instance the EU returns to a \&quot;normal,\&quot; shallow-type regional agreement, or reverts to WTO rules. Those scenarios are envisioned with or without the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU (Brexit) happening, which points to interesting cross-country differences and potential cascade effects in doing and undoing of trade agreements.},

abstract = {Exploiting changes in the geography of economic integration in Europe, this paper uses detailed bilateral trade data for 50 sectors to carry out an econometric ex post evaluation of the trade cost effects of the United Kingdom's various arrangements with the European Union. The analysis reveals important heterogeneity across agreements, sectors, and within pairs. In particular, the EU's eastward enlargement or the EU-Korea trade agreement have lowered the UK's outward trade costs only relatively modestly. These asymmetries matter for the size and distribution of the welfare effects of Brexit \textendash{} the withdrawal of the UK from EU agreements resulting into a return of trade costs to the situation quo ante. We make this point with the help of a modern multi-sector trade model that is able to capture inter- and intranational production networks. In line with other papers, the welfare costs of Brexit are higher in the UK than in most other EU countries. However, the considered asymmetries tend to attenuate overall costs while giving rise to substantial heterogeneity between EU27 members and sectors.},

New determinants that capture the rising importance of global production sharing and intraregional trade in parts and components in East Asia are proposed. Results from the extended gravity model show that the free trade agreement leads to substantially higher bilateral trade between ASEAN and the PRC, more than what a conventional gravity model predicts. The increase is concentrated in the ASEAN countries with stronger industrial linkages with the PRC.},

Our criticism of conventional practices and the proposed solution extend to a broad range of applications where log-linearized equations are estimated.

Different approaches to estimate the gravity equation, i.e. reduced-form or more structural, have been proposed. This paper examines the role of adding-up constraints as the key difference between structural gravity with “multilateral resistance” indexes and reduced-form gravity with simple fixed effects by exporter and importer. In particular, estimating gravity equations using the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator (Poisson PML) with fixed effects automatically satisfies these constraints and is consistent with the introduction of “multilateral resistance” indexes as in Anderson and van Wincoop (2003).},

abstract = {Abstract One of the most notable international economic events since 1990 has been the enormous increase in the number of free trade agreements (FTAs). While Baier and Bergstrand were the first to show empirically the impact of a country-pair's economic characteristics on the likelihood of the pair having an FTA, the literature has been extended to demonstrate the importance empirically of FTA “interdependence”—the effect of other FTAs on the probability of a pair having an FTA. In the context of the Baier–Bergstrand framework, this paper delves deeper into the sources of interdependence—an “own-FTA” effect and a “cross-FTA” effect. The authors argue that the own-FTA effect (the impact on the net welfare gains of an FTA between two countries owing to either already having other FTAs) likely dwarfs the cross-FTA effect (the impact on the net welfare gains of an FTA between the pair owing to other FTAs existing in the rest of the world, or ROW). Augmenting a parsimonious logit model with simple “multilateral FTA” and “ROW FTA” terms to differentiate the own and cross effects empirically, it is shown that the marginal impact on the probability of a country-pair having an agreement of either country having one more FTA with a third country is 50 times that of one more FTA between another pair in ROW. The results suggest that “domino (own-FTA) effects” have far exceeded “competitive liberalization (cross-FTA) effects” in the proliferation of FTAs.},

Five-year intervals are the main subject of measurement. The results show that both trade creation dummies and trade diversion dummies have statistically significant coefficients, which show the appropriateness of this new approach. The trade creation effect and trade diversion effect of each institution are proved to be generally weakening during the 1990s. It is also observed that each Organization has a distinctive international trade character. For Japanese trade, a similar approach is used to analyse nonaligned trade by Japan, with particular interest in the effects of these three institutions on trade with Japan. The result is that there is no strong evidence that the EEC and the LAFTA trade with Japan any more or less than the hypothetical level predicted by basic explanatory variables, while the CMEA increased its trade with Japan up to the hypothetical level during the analysis period.},
